# Quality Assurance

This document outlines the quality assurance practices, linting standards,
and documentation requirements for the dotfiles repository.

## Linting and Code Quality

Before committing changes, run appropriate linting tools:

### Markdown Files

```bash
markdownlint-cli2 docs/*.md README.md CLAUDE.md
```

### Shell Scripts

```bash
shellcheck bin/*.sh stow/custom-bin/bin/*
```

### TOML Configuration

```bash
# For aerospace.toml and other TOML files
taplo fmt --check stow/aerospace/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml
```

### General File Checks

```bash
# Check for common issues
find . -name "*.sh" -exec shellcheck {} \;
find . -name "*.md" -exec markdownlint-cli2 {} \;
```

## Documentation Standards

- All documentation follows markdownlint rules (80 char line length,
  proper formatting)
- Scripts include `--help` flags with usage information
- Complex configurations have accompanying reference documents in `docs/`
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages following Conventional Emoji Commits

## File Standards

### Markdown Files Standards

- Maximum 80 characters per line
- Proper spacing around headings, lists, and code blocks
- Language specified for all fenced code blocks
- Single trailing newline at end of file

### Shell Scripts Standards

- Include shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)
- Use proper quoting to prevent word splitting
- Include usage information with `--help` flag
- Add error handling for common failure cases
- Use shellcheck disable comments when intentional

### Configuration Files

- Follow the conventions of the specific tool
- Include comments explaining non-obvious settings
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Group related settings together

## Testing Requirements

### New Configurations

1. Test in a clean environment
2. Verify symlinks are created correctly
3. Test that the application can load the configuration
4. Check for conflicts with existing configurations

### Script Changes

1. Test all code paths including error conditions
2. Verify help text is accurate and complete
3. Test with various input combinations
4. Ensure backward compatibility where possible

### Documentation Updates

1. Verify all links work correctly
2. Test any code examples provided
3. Ensure formatting renders correctly
4. Check that information is up-to-date

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular reviews of linting rules and standards
- Updates to documentation as tools evolve
- Feedback incorporation from usage patterns
- Performance monitoring of complex configurations
